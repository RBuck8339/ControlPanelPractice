# ControlPanelPractice Overview:
A testing repository for a control panel run on an STM32 microcontroller. Currently using an Arduino UNO for this testing.

# Goals:
Write an Arduino program that records the inputs of 5 buttons and when an input is received, sends the states to a csv file using Processing. 
Certain buttons will be unavailable (not record an input) when another button is pressed. Simulating restricting conflicting inputs on a real control panel.

# To Do:
- Program ability for buttons to stop other buttons from receiving input while held.
- Set up Processing file.
- Verification.
- Expand.

# Breadboard Setup:
Coming Soon!
